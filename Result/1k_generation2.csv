valerio-adami_hotel-chelsea-bathroom-1968,Pop_Art,amusement,47,0,0,https://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/valerio-adami/hotel-chelsea-bathroom-1968.jpg,"The most oddest bathroom I've ever seen that also looks rather comfy The woman looks dressed and with a hat on in the bath. This is a different, colorful depiction of a simple bathroom. The weird abstract bathroom looks funny and cartoonish. A man sitting in a discombobulated bathroom that looks like something out of The Simpson's makes me laugh There appears to be a face on the toilet. the place looks like a bathroom view and the man forgot to pee in the loo and  peeded in the bathtub instead. It's funny because some of the bathroom fixtures are designed to look like body parts. This painting makes me feel very amused by all of the different shapes that were used to create this painting. I also love how there are no wavy lines. The painter just used mostly straight lines and a few curved lines. I also think that the colors work really well to create this bathroom scene. Not exactly happy, but it is very interesting that all of the objects have such angular shapes. The toilet tank especially looks like an open box. the style of art reminds me of dextors laboratory. The image of this bathroom is amusing as everything is off center and a little warped, giving it an animated and twisted appearance",Amusement
