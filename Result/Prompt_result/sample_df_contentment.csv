A biblical picture depicting Moses presenting the Ten Commandments as in the Bible. I have to assume this is a picture of Moses holding the ten commandment tablets. I feel in awe that he could hold such big stone tablets above his head, and also that he was able to talk directly to God to receive these instructions. The man looks very proud as he's holding the tablets on his hands. I just really love these old ancient style paintings that clearly depict something clearly, as in no weird shapes or odd things that I don't understand. There is a story being told with this painting. he has carried that for many many miles without rest This looks like Moses holding up the Ten Commandments. The subject matter of the Ten Commandments, who would not want to be present when the finger of God wrote on the stone tablets.  Seeing a physical miracle first hand is awe inspiring. This is awe-inspiring because it is Moses powerfully holding up the Ten Commandment tablets that he has just received from God on Mount Sinai. This man looks triumphant as he holds the stone scrolls above him. A Christian or a Jew might feel in awe of this dramatic depiction of Moses holding the Ten Commandments. The large black tablet looks like it contains a powerful text. the painting has an almost burnt in feeling to it that makes it seem intense im interested in why the artist chose such dark colors for the painting and the stress on the mans face.
